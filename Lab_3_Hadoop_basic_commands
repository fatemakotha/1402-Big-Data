1. Open terminal by right clicking on the desktop icon
2.	Start up Hadoop and the other processess, type:
    start-dfs.sh
    start-yarn.sh
3.	Using the JDK's jps utility to see which Java processes are running, type in the terminal: 
    jps
    
    What is shown? 
    2624 NodeManager
    42259 Jps
    2086 NameNode
    2370 SecondaryNameNode
    2521 ResourceManager
    2209 DataNode
    
    Explain the difference between Local filesystem and Distributed filesystem (see lecture notes)
    A. Local File System (LFS) :
    The basic file system of Linux operating system is termed as Local file system. It stores any data file as it is in single copy.
    It stores data files in Tree format. Here, any user can access data files directly. LFS does not Replicate the data blocks. 
    It always used for storing and processing personal data(small data).

    B. Distributed File System (DFS) :
    When we need to store and process a large data file (approx 1 TB size file at least), the Local file system of Operating system is not appropriate. 
    In such cases we use Distributed File system. 
    It can be created on any Linux operating system with Hadoop. DFS stores any data file by dividing it into several blocks.
    This file system works on Master-Slave format where Master is NameNode and DataNodes are the slaves. 
    All the blocks of a Data file is stored into different DataNodes and the location is only known by NameNode. 
    Every Data Block is replicated into different Datanodes to avoid data loss when any datanode fails. 
    In DFS Data files are directly not accessible to any user because only NameNode knows where the Data blocks of Data file are stored.

4.	Inspect the file system. Then type:
    mkdir -p ~/Data/Books
    What is shown?
    A test.txt file is made in Desktop/~/Data/Books folder
5.	Type:
    echo "To check this out, this is a test. This is only a test." 
    >> ~/Data/Books/test.txt


5.	Type:
    echo "To check this out, this is a test. This is only a test." >> ~/Data/Books/test.txt

6.	Next type:
    cat ~/Data/Books/test.txt 
    What has happened?
